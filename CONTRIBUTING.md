Fork the Repository
Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
Click on the Fork button at the top-right of the page.
This will create a copy of the repository under your account.
Clone Your Forked Repository
After forking, clone the repository to your local machine by running:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd repo-name
Create a New Branch
Before making any changes, always create a new branch from the main branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b your-branch-name
Branch names should be descriptive, like:

fix/issue-123
feature/new-feature-name
This keeps the changes isolated and easier to track.

Now you can start working on the issue or feature you've picked.
Follow any coding standards or best practices mentioned in the project.

Commit Your Changes
After making your changes, add and commit them:

bash

git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
Make sure the commit message is descriptive and relates to the changes made.

Push to Your Fork
Push your changes to your forked repository:

bash
Copy code
git push origin your-branch-name
Submit a Pull Request
Now that your branch is pushed to your fork, submit a pull request:

Go to the Pull Requests tab of the original repository.
Click the New Pull Request button.
Select your branch from the dropdown.
Provide a clear title and description for your changes.
Submit the pull request.
